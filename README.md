# Angular: Dynamic form

Forms in angular

Nowdays forms are a crucial part of every application over the web, a signup/signin process, a payment process, a survey and an endless kind of scenarios in our day to day life on the web.

Sometimes creating web applications goes way beyond the static and predefined forms, and there are some scenarios where having a dynamic way to create forms based on a spec from an api or changing business requirements comes really handy in order to reduce the amount of time and resources spent supporting an application.

Some great examples of this are survey monkey or google forms, where they create their forms dynamically only using a configuration created by an user.
